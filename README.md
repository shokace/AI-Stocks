<h1>What We Do</h1>

<a href="https://vailut.com">Vailut.com's</a> core focus is to bring as much information from the web and distil it all into one package. Cryptocurrencies often entail a varying degree of risk when investing, often including scams found on X and other platforms.
We want to minimize that risk, warning users when we detect potential fraud in the crypto-sphere.

This is a public repo. You can see exactly how I will process the data, and this can allow others to audit my results. 

<h3>Phase I: </h3>

Front end design and initial push for metrics. Intuitive layouts make people stay and want to be a part of the project.

<h3>Phase II: (CURRENT) </h3>

Add a predictive model that scrapes news sources and keywords for cryptocurrency talks on platforms. Show this on front end with no sign in required.

*<i>Currently getting CI working with the server. After that, I can start pushing updates with the predictive model.</i>

<h3>Phase III:</h3>

Databases. Make user accounts, track currencies you want, and get notifications as risks break out. 

<h3>Phase IV:</h3>

Listen to changes from the community, build from the basis and learn new things.
